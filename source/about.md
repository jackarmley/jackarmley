I relish the challenge of building beautiful, usable and future-proof websites that people love to use.

I've been making stuff for the web in some form or another for longer than I can remember.

I cut my teeth as an in-house designer for Lewisham CLC, where I learnt (by trial and error) the fundamentals of building and maintaining live websites. The position allowed me to experiment with the best ways of building lean, beautiful CSS on top of semantic, accessable HTML.

Next I worked for ThruSites (now ThruDigital), where I was tasked with producing finished web graphics which would be passed onto their developers to be built. It was a great experience, where I got the chance to work directly with their clients, building the designs.

In early 2008 I started work at Cog Design, helping to build beautiful websites for clients mainly in the creative sector. With every project the best solution was found to suit the client's needs. All the sites were built with usability and accessability in mind, utilising the most current web standards applicable.

I left Cog in June 2011 to join the front-end team at Tangent Snowball. There, I was part of a large, talented and passionate group of developers, designers and web-designers working on everything from mobile sites to a touch-screen in Harvey Nicks!

In April 2012 I left the team at Tangent to start a new life in Perth, WA. Now, I get to wrangle markup in the beautiful swan brewery, with the great Hatchd Digital team.
