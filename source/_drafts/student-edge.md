summary: A super-clean mobile-only site to bring sweet deals to Australa's money-conscious students
---

Student Edge is an Australia-wide service providing much needed discounts for cash-strapped students. With mobile usage fast increasing, they needed a fast, east-to-use mobile site.

We focused on providing just that, shying away from complex Javascript-driven interactions and lavish graphics in favor of a clean, zippy and retina-ready site, perfect even for those with cheaper mobiles on edge connections.

To cut down on image requests, we made heavy use of modern alternatives like webfont icons and CSS gradients.
