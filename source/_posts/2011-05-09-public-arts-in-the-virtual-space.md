Emergency Exit Arts put on energenic, dazzling street performances for hire.

They came to Cog Design needing a personality-packed, bold site to showcase their offering, and help people see what they do. The site was given a clean layout, letting their numrous bold images sing, and each section can be previeved through the main navigaton bar through a "megamenu", so the visitor can get a sense of what is contained in each area of the site. To allow EEA to manage the content, the site was built in Expression Engine.
