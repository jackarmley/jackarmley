After quite a bit of tinkering in illustrator, and messing about in [codepen](http://codepen.io/collection/vjgCd/), I've a new site design that I'm happy to leave up and build upon. My aims for this design were:

1. To break out of any css techniques/tools I've been using for a while, and have become  familiar with (floats, normalize etc...). I wanted to start my css completely blank, to better remind myself *why* I use these tools, and *what* they actually do. It's very easy to become comfortable doing things a certain way (despite the fact that I often rip thing things out and start again) so I wanted to go round the hard way, where the basics aren't prepped for me (like removing the margin on the body tag, and the annoying top margin on paragraphs).
2. To use flexbox, not floats for the layout, as It will be the way to go in a few years, so I wanted to understand it more.
3. To use SASS. Ive been using LESS for around 2 years. It is a great tool, but as builds I've worked on have become more complex (incremental rotating of elements using CSS transforms etc...) I yearned for the non-declarative, more programm-y nature of SASS, where you can iterate over arrays, make for loops and stuff like that.
4. To really stick with a design and push it as far as I can (as a non-designer) to ensure it has plenty of personality, and isn't just a jumble of disparate elements.

Having set out, I'm now at a half-way point, there's still rough edges: at smaller widths (like mobile devices) It's still not perfect; it is untested on anything but Chrome; my '.scss' files are a little disorganised; the work listing page could be made more interesting.

Now I've uploaded the site, I've impetus tick some of this list off. Whether people love or hate it, the site finally feels like mine again, which feels good. Onwards!
