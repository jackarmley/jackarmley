Brownes, a household name in WA for fresh dairy products, needed a farm-fresh
new look. To evoke a rustic feel the design was rich with skewmorphism. It was quite
the challenge to make such a richly textured design fully responsive, and (relatively)
quick to download.

I'm particularly proud of the responsive content panels. We used a simple class
system that allowed us to switch their appearance based on a secondary class,
so all the markup could be kept the same.
