summary: Revamping SLS's prescence in Western Australia
---

Surf Life Saving is Australia's largest voluntary organisation. It's 300+ clubs help ensure the country's beaches remain safe for all to enjoy.

Western Australia's site needed a revamp, to help raise awareness of the club and provide vital information for beach-goers, surfers and swimmers.

We built a clean, bright and clear design making good use of SLSWA's extensive photography archive, with several reusable modules allowing the SLSWA team to clerly map out a huge amount of content.
