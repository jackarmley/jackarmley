As part of a great team at Tangent Snowball, I helped to bring the "Couture" and "Try It On" sections of the site to fruition.

I worked with an amazing team of account handlers, UX architects and designers to help nails inc bring the experience of trying on their products into the virtual realm.

"Try It On" is a pluggable module that appears in multiple places on the site, but has its own dedicated page. We spent a worrying amount of time trying on nail varnish in order to represent their product correctly on screen, as we wanted to ensure we could build each colour with a modular system of layers and CSS classes.

The Couture section allows the visitor to build their own bespoke nail varnish. The section had to be available both on touch-based smartphones, and desktops, do to accomodate this need we re-thought the user experience for each platform (for example, on iPad/iPhone, if the device is rotated you get a preview of your assembled nail varnish). Including interactions like drag-and-drop, and animated transitions was great fun, and an interesting challenge.

I really enjoyed working on these two features - at Tangent we took a really agile approach to ensure we really understood how the user would interact with each feature and as a result I think it works really well (the site got recieved with buckets of delight from nails inc's expansive Facebook following).
