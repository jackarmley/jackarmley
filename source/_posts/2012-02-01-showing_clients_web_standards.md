At Tangent Snowball we wanted to ensure the sites we were building were future-ready. To do this, older browsers needed a different treatment and we needed a tool to communicate this philosophy to our clients.

The key to any great website is ensuring the correct things are kept in the frame.

When a large website is commissioned, it's easy to concentrate too hard on trying to replicate all the nuances of a PSD in all browsers, which can slow a site down for all its users. At Tangent Snowball, we wanted to ensure the sites we were building were fast and flexible, and could be comfortably accessed on the myriad of devices and screens used to browse the web today.

To achieve this, we needed to utlize modern web techniques that replicate things like drop-shadows, gradients and icons without using a boat-load of images and Javascript. Using these tools meant that we'd need to cater a little differently for older browsers (like IE6/7 and FIrefox 3.6), serving them a slightly less "HD" experience then their modern equivilents.

However, this type of treatment is hard to apply when the client has already seen visuals and as such will expect the same look and feel across the board. We created a booklet to explain to our clients that serving a slightly more stripped-back design to older browsers is a good thing, as their site will perform better for all their users.

After the book was finished, the Front-End team gave a short, engaging workshop to introduce it to all the internal teams.
