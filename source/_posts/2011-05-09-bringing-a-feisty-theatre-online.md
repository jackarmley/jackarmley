Founded in 1993, Told by an Idiot is a small theatre company with a big reputation.

To help convey their quirky, playful personality their website switches randomly between a left / right aligned layout when a new page is loaded.

Whilst each page is clean and easy to read, it is surrounded by playfully cut-out images from their back-catalouge of productions, and each page has a colourful, vibrant background.

I helped build the site in Expression Engine, as part of Cog Design
