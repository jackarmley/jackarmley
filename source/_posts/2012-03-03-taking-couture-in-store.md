Two popular areas of nails inc's new website - Couture and Try It On - were to be transposed from their desktop/mobile environment to be available in-store, on an interactive touchscreen.

Re-thinking these two sections for their new destination presented both a challenge and and opportunity.

The challenge was that the touch screen we'd be using was not an iPad, but was more of a highly durable public screen (like those used in airports and train stations). Also, given it's users wouldn't be in the posture of a typical website user (sitting down, on their own device) but would be standing up in a public environment we couldn't use any prior knowledge to make UX decisions but had to re-think our assumptions.

The opportunity was that we were designing for one screen size and a single browser of our choosing (which turned out, after much trial-and-error to be Firefox). This meant we could really pull out all the stops and design a visually beautiful site using all the modern tools we could lay our hands on.

As a result, we managed to create a lightweight but visually-rich site, building depth and colour richness using mutliple drop shadows, CSS3 gradients and RGBA colours.

One technique I'm really proud of is the [chevron-style progress bar]("http://dabblet.com/preview/gist/1684614") on the Couture section. It was made with pure CSS3 (no images).
