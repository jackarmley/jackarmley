I created the iluv2 site for Lewisham CLC; it stemmed from a web design course they were running with their students.

The end goal of the course was to get their website published, and this site was a tool to publish and host each site. Although I designed this way back in 2006, I still love it; I really got to flex my illustrating muscle, designing all the graphics and logo from scratch. Also, given the entire site is built in Flash, I got to create some beautiful animations and play with in-depth Actionscript.
