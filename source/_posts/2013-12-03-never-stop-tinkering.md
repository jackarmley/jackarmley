No process is perfect; no chunk of css is flawless. Just because something has been tried and tested on 100 builds, doesn't mean it shouldn't be revisited.

Take a look at that something sitting in your trusty base set of styles, overlooked time and time again in favor of trying out a shiny new css3 gradient or calc grid. Revisit it; see if it can be improved, given a fresh lick of paint, see if it can benefit from all that awesome new stuff you've learned over the last few builds. Your styles may lose a few kilobytes, there may be 10 lines in there that were hanging around just in case IE6 came calling. Your css will thank you.
