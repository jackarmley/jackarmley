"London's largest outdoor arts festival" pulled in 825,000+ visitors in 2010, with the website recieving 1.25m page views.

As part of Cog Design, I helped build the site in Expression Engine (with the design concept being provided by "Why Not"). During the build process, we focused on speed, taking as many steps as we could to ensure the site would be ready for the large traffic levels it recieves over the festival. One of these steps was to use webfonts to serve the site's headline font (Amasis).
