summary: A one-stop destination for Chicken Treat fans
---

Chicken Treat needed a one-stop online shop for their customers to see menus, nutritional information and outlet locations.

To achieve more family appeal, loud colours and brash graphics were scrapped,
in favor of a richly textured, farm-y look-and-feel.

### Build highlight

The design featured lots of textured panels that traditionally would have taken
lots of seperate images and markup bloat to produce. For browsers that could,
we employed the css3 border-image property, theat saved on image requests and
meant the boxes could flex to different widths.
