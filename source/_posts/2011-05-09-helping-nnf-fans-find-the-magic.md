The Norfolk and Nowich Festival is long-established, with a varied programme and audience.

The 2011 site is well-laid out, making it easy for festival-goers to buy tickets, and also has an engaging interactive element (NNF Live) where, during the festival, photos can be submitted to a Flickr group which are then fed into the site.

Cog Design had created their site for 2010, so this site built on that structure, with changes made based on user and client feedback. A significant change was to bring in their headline font as a webfont.
