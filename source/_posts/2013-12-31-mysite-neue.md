summary: On our personal sites, implementing shaky new features is fair game. This is what such sites are all about.

The CSS spec never stands still; new features are constantly debated, dropped, revised and refreshed. These features are exciting, and we need to be across how they work to ensure we understand how to use them when they gain decent support.

As professional web designers however, we need to be careful about which features we use on production sites - clients are paying for stuff that works, so to go about messing with flexbox and regions on a live build could be hugely irresponsible.

On our personal sites however, implementing shaky new features is fair game. This is what these sites should be all about. They are our sites, our sandboxes and as such (unless we are sole traders and they are our shopfronts) we shouldn't need to worry about browser support - let's have fun and "just build websites!" (in the words of Chris Coyier).
