Before the launch of their present site, Tangent Snowball were known by a different name, so the site had to both reassure current clients that change was for the better, and propel the new brand into public conciousness.

The initial site, although small was an opportunity for the Tangent Snowball team to show off their collective skills. With this in mind, we set out to produce a stunning responsive design, and a re-worked mobile site. We decided, rather than the design packing down to mobile it would stop at iPad portrait width (768 pixels), and from that point on a seperate mobile site would take over.

The desktop site works beautifully on any platform, but it particularly good on iPad, as it utilizes all space on the device. The whole site uses large, sumptuous images and snappy text to bring the work to life.

As we created a seperate mobile site, we could re-format all the images for mobile, use application caching to ensure the site was super-quick, and re-design the page structure to make full sue of the small screen real-estate. Also, we ensured all graphics were optimised for iPhone 4's Retina display.
