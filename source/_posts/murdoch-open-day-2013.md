Murdoch University run an open day each year to attract potential new students. Their main site isn't mobile friendly, so they needed a clean, responsive microsite to inform visitors about the day.

Budget was tight, so we made a simple, one-page static site that the Murdoch digital team could host and manage. The design used a few well-placed images, supported by strong typography and white-space which scaled well from small to large sizes.

## Build insight

The design called for a bespoke dotted line, not achievable through the standard `border: 1px dotted` rule. To make it, I used a repeating radial gradient with multiple backgrounds, and `background-size.`

## Built with

- HTML5
- LESS
- jQuery
