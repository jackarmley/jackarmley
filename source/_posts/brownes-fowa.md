summary: Championing local WA flavoured milk over imported alternatives
---

Flavoured milk is a highly competitive market in Perth, and Brownes wanted to
get Western Australaians to drink their locally-made prodcuct in favor of alternatives
shipped in from the East Coast.

The campaign centered around 'Flavours of WA': Visitors to a
simple microsite could rename their favourite flavour using a suitable WA
colloqualism; the best wold would get pride of place on billboards and
limited-run packaging.

The site had to be bold and bright. It had to serve both as a new flavour showcase
and fun a and simple way to to submit new flavours.

## Build insights

### 180 degree nav

In the campaign branding, the flavours were shown in a wheel. We thought it would
be great to utilize that as the navigation users use to get to each flavour group.

### Saved by the 'vh'

Each flavor group was displayed as a slide that took the height of the screen.
Achievng this in a responsive environent is tricky; fortunately
'viewport units' had reasonable browser support by then, so the old method of
applying window height via Javascript was replaced by a far cleaner `100vh.`
