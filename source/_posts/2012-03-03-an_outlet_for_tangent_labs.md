Tangent Labs, Tangent Snowball's gifted in-house team of devs needed a website to reach out to their community and publish their insights.

The site germinated at a dev weekend, where I joined all the guys who hate GUI's in Oxford for half of their 2 day session. With me, I had a lovely set of visuals from one of our design team and my (rather ponderous) Windows laptop.

The aim was to build the site that weekend, and we certainly got a large chunk of it done. It was a great process, sitting on a table with the 4 or so devs assembled to build the site, throwing questions back and fourth and piecing each page together.

After this initial period, the site was refined and fleshed out and the CSS formalised. Working with the designer I wrote a responsive grid system, that would change the site by snaps (not fluid widths) from a large desktop screen down to a portrait-orientation iPad. Beyond this point, a flexible-width mobile design took over. This work was done in a few concentrated sessions in the studio, where pizza was always close to hand and was given a final brush-up by the design and front-end teams. Right before launch, the CSS was converted to use LESS to ensure it was easier for other front-end developers to work with.

As the dev community prides itself on being foreward-thinking, catering for legacy versions of Internet Explorer was not a huge focus. We ensured the site would work a treat in IE9 and upwards, and served a modified version of the mobile stylesheet for IE8 and below. Concentrating on modern browsers meant we could run with our front-end presentational code, using CSS3 to full effect. I'm particulary proud of the submit buttons on the contact and search forms, which use no images whatsoever - just multiple CSS3 gradients and plenty of outset and inset drop shadows.

For me, the site has fulfilled its goal of being something the dev team can really use to express themselves and reach out to other devs with. It's only been up a short while, and I'm noticing blog posts springing up left and right, and bios for team members being refined.
