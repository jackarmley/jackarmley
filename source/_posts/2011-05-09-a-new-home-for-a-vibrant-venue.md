Located in beautiful Newbury, the Corn Exchange (and New Greenham Arts) run a packed schedule of flms, performances and workshops.

The site is focused on making these events easy to browse through and book.

It is cleanly laid out, with text set in easy-to-read Verdana, and the headline font was originally added to the site using sIFR (a technique that uses Abobe Flash to apply the font file to selected text).

Just before I left the team at Cog Design however, I helped update the site, replacing the sIFR text with modern, quick-loading webfonts, which meant we could give the site the typographic look we had originally intended it to have. Also, some nice megamenus were added to the navigation, to help users find key content quickly and easily.
