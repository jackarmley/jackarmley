summary: Bringing renewed vibrancy to MRA's online home
---

MRA (the Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority) needed a punchy online prescence, both informative and vibrant in equal measure and 
able to work perfectly on all devices and screen sizes.

They are a government organization, steering all the major place-making projects for a growing Perth.
Being a government site accessibility was vitally important, beyond just checking off a WCAG 2.0 ticklist.

They are behind all the major building projects in Perth, all of which had seperate microsites. 
The goal was to bring all these disperate microsites into the new MRA site, 
and to make it clear MRA was behind them all.
