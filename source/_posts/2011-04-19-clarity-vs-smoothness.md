summary: apple mac users will get more smoothly rendered fonts across all browsers, but this doesn't mean if a font you pick doesn't look as smooth on windows it should be discounted.

When picking a webfont, a designer should always remember to think outside the mac.

It's true, due to the Quartz rendering engine on the Mac OS, mac users will get more smoothly rendered fonts across all browsers, but this doesn't mean if a font you pick doesn't look as smooth on windows it should be discounted.

Rather, you should focus on how clear it is (how easy to read), because Windows users are used to seeing fonts rendered on Windows (yes, even Georgia looks different).

So always remember clarity, as well as smoothness is important.
