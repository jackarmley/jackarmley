<h1 id="Contributing">Contributing</h1><p>If you want to add functionality to this project, pull requests are welcome.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a branch based off master and do all of your changes within it.</li>
<li>Make sure commits are as ‘atomic’ as possible (this way specific changes can be removed or cherry-picked more easily)</li>
<li>Do not make pull requests monolithic in nature as this makes reviewing difficult and chances are your pull request will be declined (depending on complexity).</li>
<li>If you have to pause to add an ‘and’ anywhere in the title, it should be two pull requests.</li>
<li>Make commits of logical units and describe them properly</li>
<li>Check for unnecessary whitespace with git diff —check before committing.</li>
<li>If possible, submit tests to your patch/new feature so it can be tested easily.</li>
<li>Assure nothing is broken by running all tests</li>
<li>Please ensure that it complies with coding standards.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Please raise any issues with this project as a GitHub issue.</strong></p>
