My aims for this design were:</p>
<ol>
<li>To break out of any css techniques/tools I’ve been using for a while, and have become  familiar with (floats, normalize etc…). I wanted to start my css completely blank, to better remind myself <em>why</em> I use these tools, and <em>what</em> they actually do. It’s very easy to become comfortable doing things a certain way (despite the fact that I often rip thing things out and start again) so I wanted to go round the hard way, where the basics aren’t prepped for me (like removing the margin on the body tag, and the annoying top margin on paragraphs).</li>
<li>To use flexbox, not floats for the layout, as It will be the way to go in a few years, so I wanted to understand it more.</li>
<li>To use SASS. Ive been using LESS for around 2 years. It is a great tool, but as builds I’ve worked on have become more complex (incremental rotating of elements using CSS transforms etc…) I yearned for the non-declarative, more programm-y nature of SASS, where you can iterate over arrays, make for loops and stuff like that.</li>
<li>To really stick with a design and push it as far as I can (as a non-designer) to ensure it has plenty of personality, and isn’t just a jumble of disparate elements.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having set out, I’m now at a half-way point, there’s still rough edges: at smaller widths (like mobile devices) It’s still not perfect; it is untested on anything but Chrome; my ‘.scss’ files are a little disorganised; the work listing page could be made more interesting.</p>
<p>Now I’ve uploaded the site, I’ve impetus tick some of this list off. Whether people love or hate it, the site finally feels like mine again, which feels good. Onwards!</p>
