<p>My experience with using icon fonts didn’t start with downloading and installing a third-party set; I think the best way to understand something is to give it a bash, so while at Tangent Snowball I helped to develop an icon set called Snowcone.</p>
<p>I authored a clutch of icons, which was refined and expanded upon by the Tangent Snowball design team.</p>
<p>It worked great, and since leaving Tangent I’ve used it on a number of projects at Hatchd (as it was made open source), and if I make new icons for a project, if they’re generic enough I’ll generally roll them back into the core repo so everyone can benefit from them.</p>
<p>What I love about the set is I can create new icons, so I’m not led by the style of a third-party set, and as I understand how they’re made, I can more effectively manage hinting issues and consistency within the set.</p>
<p>What’s always been an issue however, is that when using something like Snowcone or Fontawesome, you start with a big set of icons that the browser needs to load, even if you only use one or two.</p>
<p>Also, making additions to a custom set is time-consuming and painstaking, and requires a basic knowledge of how everything works to do. The process is usually:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add the icon to the illustrator template, where it is sized 16x16px.</li>
<li>Paste icon into a staging template, sized at 2048x2048px, so it matches the metrics of the font.</li>
<li>Open Glyphs and paste the upscaled icon into a blank slot in the uncomplied glyphs icon file.</li>
<li>Export the glyphs icon file as a ttf.</li>
<li>Generate the other required font files from this , using fontprep or fontsquirrel.</li>
<li>Create a new CSS class for the icon within the project.</li>
</ol>
<p>Phew! Crikey, that’s a lot of steps, and the other issue with adding icons into empty slots at the end of a list o existing icons, is that no matter how hard you try, the set becomes disorganized - if you add an alternative twitter icon to a set it may be lumped in with a bunch if unrelated ones.</p>
<p>What I really wanted to do if make a tool like icomoon, where I could generate a font set out of custom glyphs, but have it out of the browser and more tightly intergrated with my workflow.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a couple of awesome Ruby devs ( <a href="http://twitter.com/endtwist" target="_blank" rel="external">@endtwist</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/exYZ" target="_blank" rel="external">@ezYZ</a> ) have created an awesome little gem called fontcustom that does exactly this - it takes a folder of svg files and, with a simple terminal command spits out a webfont in all 4 file formats, and a CSS file with all the classes in:</p>
<pre><code><span class="title">fontcustom</span> /src -n <span class="string">"Hatchd-Eggbox"</span> -o /compiled
</code></pre><p>(Look in “src” for the vector icons, then output it to he folder “compiled” with the name “Hatchd-Eggbox”)</p>
<p>Also, it maps each glyph to a PUA character (which is what Snowcone does), which tramples accessibility concerns.</p>
<p>The only issue I found was the generated code doesn’t support IE7 as - like all good webfont icon sets - it uses a CSS pseudo-class (:before) to insert the icon.</p>
<p>As a fix was needed, I managed to hack together some additions to the gem which generate a js IE7 fix (the same script used in Snowcone) and a useful demo file which shows a list of all the icons.</p>
<p>To rebuild and install the gem from the forked repo I had modified (instead of from the Ruby gem site), I needed some additional commands:</p>
<pre><code><span class="built_in">cd</span> [<span class="built_in">path</span> to repo]
sudo gem build fontcustom.gemspec
sudo gem install fontcustom
</code></pre><p>This is still way rough around the edges - the script isn’t tested and I haven’t got nearly as many icons in as I’d like - but it’s a good start, and I can see it being a far easier way to work win webfont icons.</p>
<p>On my wishlist, is to figure out what metrics the gem uses to generate the icons (as it uses fontforge to handle it), so I can create well-hinted glyphs. At the moment, I’m using the standard icomoon svg template, which is 512x512px, with an overlaid 16x16 grid.</p>
<p>I feel a little embarrassed about my Ruby hacking, but if the gem’s creators see my additions as worthwhile, it would be great to see them rolled in (cleaned up first of course!).</p>
