To avoid this situation, you gotta get a little geeky.</p>
<p>I think (especially when working as part of a team), that making rules for yourself is really important. One such rule I always stick to, is to use good naming conventions.</p>
<p>For me, this applies across the board, but I thought I’d share the geeky way I name images. Previous to defining a rigid system for myself, I could devise no sensible way of naming an image. If, for example you have the image for a twitter icon, do you call it: twitter_icon, twitter_bird, twitter_image etc…? For some, maybe not important I can understand; for me, it kept me awake at night</p>
<p>The system I came up with, was to start the image name with the area the image would be used, then state the function of the image (background image, replaced text, logo and so on), then give it a unique name. So, the image for a twitter icon, located in the site’s footer would be:</p>
<pre><code>footer-icon_twitter<span class="class">.gif</span> (location-function_uniqueName)
</code></pre><p>For me, this saves time during a build, as I don’t have to constantly think about what to call something. Also, when I have a list of images (which can happen even if you’re using a sprite image),. it’s easier to scan what goes where.</p>
<p>Drop a comment, and let me know your naming conventions (or if I’m totally geeky and need to get out more).</p>
