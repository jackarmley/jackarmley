Since it’s inception I’ve moved countries and as a result, no longer have a desktop machine; in my spare time I usually stay connected through one of 3 i-devices, or a low-spec laptop.</p>
<p>To put a post together on my site requires a fair bit of work, and at the very least I need to be on the laptop to publish a post, as I need to do so through the Expression Engine Control Panel.</p>
<p>This isn’t ideal; I haven’t published anything since being in Australia. I’ve been looking for an alternative system that would allow me to write a post on my phone, using Markdown on IA Writer, or Evernote.</p>
<p>Jekyll was too developer-y for me, and I didn’t have the stones (or patience) to use some funky Python CMS…</p>
<h2 id="Enter_Statamic">Enter Statamic</h2><p>I found the answer by following a Twitter thread between two friends (and old colleagues) of mine. They linked to Statamic, which is a text-only CMS, using nothing but php and a bit of YAML to string a site together. Posts can be written in Markdown and the admin panel is optional (and mobile friendly).</p>
<p>This was too good to pass-up, so I’ve installed it here on this subdomain and will be building out a new site here (and along the way making some style improvements).</p>
<p>I’ve stored the site as a git repo in bitbucket and can deploy revisions via the terminal using the Dandelion Ruby Gem, which is way awesome!</p>
<p>I’ll post any useful insights I find and before I forget; thanks Simon <a href="&quot;http://twitter.com/thoughtfulweb&quot;">(@thoughtfulweb)</a> and Kat <a href="&quot;http://twitter.com/katkerber&quot;">(@katkerber)!</a></p>
