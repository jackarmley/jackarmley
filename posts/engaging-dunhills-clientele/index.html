<p>Dunhill is a well-established, luxury menswear brand with discerning customers. They wanted an interactive advertisement to be placed in the Economist iPad edition, to help their “Voice” campaign reach a wider audience.</p>
<p>Of great importance to Dunhill was that the look and feel of the print campaign (from which this originated) were to be carried through seamlessly to the iPad. As such, we couldn’t provide distinctively farmilliar iPad-like visual cues for playing each video, or navigating between slides. Instead, we stripped everything right back.</p>
<p>We concentrated on creating something as luxurious as possible, within the guidelines the Economist provided for producing an ad. As we couldn’t replicate th exact environment the ad would live in on the regular iPad Safari browser, our in-house iOS developer made a basic iPad app to test our work in.</p>
<p>We used the Brightcove platform to stream the videos, which went through several quality refinements until we were happy with the balance between crispness and download size.</p>
