<p>I worked with an amazing team of account handlers, UX architects and designers to help nails inc bring the experience of trying on their products into the virtual realm.</p>
<p>“Try It On” is a pluggable module that appears in multiple places on the site, but has its own dedicated page. We spent a worrying amount of time trying on nail varnish in order to represent their product correctly on screen, as we wanted to ensure we could build each colour with a modular system of layers and CSS classes.</p>
<p>The Couture section allows the visitor to build their own bespoke nail varnish. The section had to be available both on touch-based smartphones, and desktops, do to accomodate this need we re-thought the user experience for each platform (for example, on iPad/iPhone, if the device is rotated you get a preview of your assembled nail varnish). Including interactions like drag-and-drop, and animated transitions was great fun, and an interesting challenge.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed working on these two features - at Tangent we took a really agile approach to ensure we really understood how the user would interact with each feature and as a result I think it works really well (the site got recieved with buckets of delight from nails inc’s expansive Facebook following).</p>
